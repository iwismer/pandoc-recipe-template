steps_split:
  Cake:
    - Grease a 9"x13" cake pan (or line it with parchment paper or aluminum foil and grease the sides and bottom). Set aside.
    - Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
    - In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, salt, sugar and baking powder.
    - Add milk, eggs and vanilla and whisk until smooth.
    - Slowly add the melted butter and whisk until everything is smooth.
    - Spread the batter in the prepared pan. Set aside.
    - In a medium mixing bowl, beat butter with electric mixer until creamy.
    - Add sugar, flour and cinnamon and beat until fluffy, about 2 minutes. (It will look crumbly at first but keep beating, it will come together.)
    - Spread the filling over the cake batter, leaving at least 1 inch of space from the edge of the pan. Swirl gently with a off-set icing spatula or a rubber spatula.
    - Bake the cake for 28 to 32 minutes or until the toothpick inserted in the cake part comes out clean.
    - Cool the cake for 15 minutes. Pour the glaze over the cake and spread evenly.
  Glaze:
    - Sift the powdered sugar over a medium mixing bowl.
    - Add vanilla and milk and whisk together until smooth and drizzling consistency. Spread over still warm cake.

notes: |
  Keeps covered in room temperature for up to 3 days.

  This cake in quite sweet, try reducing the amount of glaze, or the amount of sugar in the cake/filling.
